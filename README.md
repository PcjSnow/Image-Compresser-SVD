# Image-Compressor-SVD
A simple Python program that uses Linear Algebra techniques, namely, Singular Value Decomposition, to compress an image file.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique (such as the LU or QR factorizations) that can be applied to any real matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}_{m\times n}$.

The SVD factorizes $A$ into three matrices: an orthogonal matrix $U \in \mathbb{R}_{n\times n}$. a diagonal matrix $Î£ \in \mathbb{R}_{m\times n}$ and another orthogonal matrix $V \in \mathbb{R}_{n\times n}$. The SVD allows as to compute A in terms of these matrices: $A = U\sigmaV^{T}$
