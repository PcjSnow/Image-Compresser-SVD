# Image-Compressor-SVD
A simple Python program that uses Linear Algebra techniques, namely, Singular Value Decomposition, to compress an image file.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique (such as the LU or QR factorizations) that can be applied to any real matrix $A \in
